# 🧠 Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog & Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

Welcome to **Day 4** of the RTL Design Workshop!  
Today, we explore **critical concepts that bridge RTL and real hardware**, ensuring that what you write actually works as intended after synthesis.

We'll deep-dive into:

- 🧪 **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** — validating synthesized logic
- 🔄 **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments** — crucial for writing correct RTL
- ⚠️ **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch** — why RTL and synthesized netlists might behave differently

This session is packed with both **practical labs** and **real-world insights** to help you write **reliable, synthesizable Verilog** and catch issues early in the flow. Let’s get started! 🚀
